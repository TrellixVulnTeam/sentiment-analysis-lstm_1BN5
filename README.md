# Sentiment Analysis using LSTM

Sentiment Analysis is a process of determining whether a given statement is positive, negative or neutral. A basic task in sentiment analysis is classifying the polarity of a given text of the document, sentence, or feature/aspect level—whether the expressed opinion in a document, a sentence or an entity feature/aspect is positive, negative, or neutral.
